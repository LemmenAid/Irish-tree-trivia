      Despite its green image, Ireland has surprisingly little forest. Across Europe, nations average around
      35% forest cover but in Ireland the figure is just 11%, one of the lowest on the continent!
      This hasn't always been the case. Thousands of years ago, more than 80% of Ireland was
      covered in trees. Over many centuries they were almost entirely chopped down to make way for fields and
      pasture and by 1925 only 1% was forested. The only trees that remained were on land that was unsuitable for any
      type of agriculture. 
      <br>
      For a number of decades the government has paid farmers and other private landowners to plant
      trees on their land in place of intensive agriculture. But these grants, so far, have fallen short of reaching
      their target of 18% forest cover. Until recently forestry was considered valuable only as a supply of timber to be
      harvested. This explains why, of the 11% of Ireland that is forested, the vast majority (9% of
      the country) is planted with spruces like the Sitka spruce, a fast growing conifer originally from Alaska which
      can be harvested after just 15 years. This non-native tree has a negative impact on Ireland's biodiversity, native
      woodlands and landscape. Good thing is, awareness is growing and there are more and more initiatives out there to
      plant native Irish trees!
