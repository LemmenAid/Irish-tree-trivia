    <p class="intro-text">"Around 12,000 years ago, Ireland was covered in snow and ice. This was known as the
      Ice Age. As the weather became warmer, the snow and ice melted and trees began to grow. The seeds of trees such as
      hazel and oak were brought here by birds and animals, across the landbridges from Britain and the rest of Europe.
      The seeds of other trees, such as willow and birch, are so light that they were blown here by the wind."
      "Eventually, the seas rose, the landbridges were flooded and Ireland became an island. Our native trees
      are the trees that reached here before we were separated from the rest of Europe. Our most common native
      trees include oak, ash, hazel, birch, Scots pine, rowan and willow. Eventually, people brought other trees,
      such as beech, sycamore, horse chestnut, spruce, larch and fir to Ireland." - Irish Tree Council

    <p class="intro-text">
      Despite its green image, Ireland has surprisingly little forest. Across Europe, nations average around
      35% forest cover but in Ireland the figure is just 11%, one of the lowest on the continent.
      This hasn't always been the case. Thousands of years ago, more than 80% of the island of Ireland was
      covered in trees. Over many centuries they were then almost entirely chopped down to make way for fields and
      pasture and by 1925, only 1% was forested. The only trees that remained were on land that was unsuitable for any
      type of agriculture. For a number of decades the government has paid farmers and other private landowners to plant
      trees on their land in place of intensive agriculture. But these grants have so far fallen short of reaching their
      target of 18% forest cover. Until recently forestry was considered valuable only as a supply of timber to be
      harvested. This explains why, of that 11% of the Republic of Ireland that is forested, the vast majority (9% of
      the country) is planted with spruces like the Sitka spruce, a fast growing conifer originally from Alaska which can be
      harvested after just 15 years. This non-native tree has a negative impact on our biodiversity. If you have ever
      walked through one of these plantations, you have experienced first hand how these threes create a 'dead-zone'
      instead of a lively forest.

      It is important to value the natural world around us and that start with having a bit of knowledge. So dive in and
      test your Tree Trivia, and you might learn something along the way..
